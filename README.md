# Sony_PSP_Painter (Beware the lame coding)

this is my very first side project when I started to learn coding an year ago, and I simply did it out of interest, so the coding might be lame.

I wrote almost every thing inside the main function because of the unstablility of the PSP SDK toolchain.
For some reason this 2002 machine runs more stable when everything is written in main().

If you want to open it with a PSP simulator...
- download the entire folder and throw the EBOOT file into the PPSSPP simulator.
